# BLE-tracker
A real-time indoor positioning system designed to monitor elderly movement using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) and ESP32 microcontrollers. BLE beacons emit signals that are collected by ESP32 nodes, processed over MQTT, and stored in a Supabase database. A Next.js-based frontend provides a live dashboard for caregivers.
